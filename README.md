<b>Android Side</b>
<p>
Folder RemoteComputer contains the android application code. The code has been compiled using android SDK 21, and needs a mobile device running android v5.0 to work. However lower versions maybe supported, for that the minSDK in the Manifest file must be changed accordingly.
<br>Android studio v1.4 has been used as the IDE for the development.
<br>JDK v1.8u60 has been used for code compilation.
